# udagram-refactor

Udagram is a simple cloud application, which is developed while enrollment in the *Udacity Nanodegree - Cloud Developer*. 
The main achievement in this project was to refactor a monolith to a microservice based cloud application. 

This is achieved by splitting the monolith into 4 parts:
- Frontend
- Rest-Api-Feed
- Rest-Api-User
- A reverseproxy

Everything is deployed via EKS in AWS.

The subprojects are included in this repositor as submodules.

This project is build using Typescript and the Ionic framework. For more instructions how to start, please look into the repository.

### Setting up a GitHub Actions CI Pipeline
This part differs a bit of the script, as I am not using TravisCI but Github Actions. This has two main reasons:
- First in a "real world" implementation each of the microservices would be independent repositories
- Second these repositories would be wanted to be build at seperate times, because multiple teams are working on these. 
Additionally TravisCI is requiring a CreditCard as they have a "Freemium" Model. Github Actions are completly free for public repositories.
